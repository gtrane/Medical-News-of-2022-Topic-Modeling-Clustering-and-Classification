       " '\"Yesterday in the afternoon, the first case of monkeypox in our country was confirmed,\" Health Minister Luis Sucre said during a press conference, adding the patient \"is completely stable\" and the \"case is properly controlled.\"',\n",
       " 'The patient, whose nationality and sex were not revealed, was isolating at home after being notified of a possible monkeypox infection, Sucre said.',\n",
       " 'The person was later transferred to a medical facility.',\n",
       " 'Three lesions typical of monkeypox were found on the patient\\'s body, though the person is \"practically asymptomatic,\" authorities said.',\n",
       " 'Tests confirmed the patient was infected with the \"least serious\" strain of monkeypox, which is less lethal, according to the director of the Gorgas Memorial Laboratory, Juan Pascale.',\n",
       " 'More than 50 countries around the world where monkeypox is not endemic have reported outbreaks of the viral disease as total recorded cases exceeded 5,820 cases Tuesday.',\n",
       " '(Reporting by Eli Moreno; Writing by Kylie Madry; Editing by Marguerita Choy)',\n",
       " \"As a physician, you may ruminate over an interaction with a patient or worry about a complicated procedure that didn't go as expected.\",\n",
       " 'You work through lunch, see patients after hours, handle numerous emergencies, and plow through endless paperwork and red tape.',\n",
       " 'In short: factors related to practicing medicine can put enormous stress on physicians.',\n",
       " 'In the Medscape Physician Burnout & Depression Report 2023, 53% of physicians consider themselves burned out, an 11% rise since the pre-COVID-19 survey of 2018.',\n",
       " 'Causes range from too much bureaucracy and time spent on electronic health records to feeling overworked and underappreciated to a lack of autonomy and too much governmental oversight.',\n",
       " '\"When stress becomes unhealthy, you might notice sleep problems, such as going many days with poor-quality sleep, or being up in bed worrying about what you have to do the next day,\" says Jonathan DePierro, PhD, associate professor of psychiatry at Mount Sinai and associate director of the Center for Stress, Resilience, and Personal Growth at Mount Sinai.',\n",
       " '\"Being particularly irritable or on edge is a sign that stress has sunk in its claws,\" he says.',\n",
       " 'You may feel tense a lot of the time and have trouble enjoying things in life.',\n",
       " '\"In the field of medicine, there is so much pressure to not only be a caretaker but to always be the expert, to always have all the answers,\" says Laura Putnam, founder and CEO of Motion Infusion, a thought leadership company who provides workplace wellness support to organizations like Kaiser Permanente and the American Heart Association.',\n",
       " 'She is the author of  Workplace Wellness That Works.',\n",
       " '\"There\\'s this enormous amount of pressure around demonstrating competency that\\'s competing against the need to be vulnerable.\"',\n",
       " \"Isn't Being a Physician Just a Stressful Job?\",\n",
       " 'Yes and no.',\n",
       " '\"Gallup research shows that the top five drivers of burnout in the workplace have nothing to do with the individual but have everything to do with the workplace itself: things like work overload, toxicity, and perceptions of unfairness,\" Putnam says.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s important for physicians to be able to understand there are a lot of headwinds they\\'re up against that makes it really hard not to be burned out.\"',\n",
       " 'In addition, research by the Agency for Healthcare and Research Quality has pointed to measures such as staff surveys, flexible schedules, a better work-home balance as well as help with EHR entry as steps practices can employ to help offset some of this stress.',\n",
       " 'However, these are primarily organization-level changes that require a top-down approach.',\n",
       " 'In the Medscape report, 29% of physicians reduced their work hours to relieve stress, 25% used meditation, 22% changed their workflow or staffing, and 21% changed jobs altogether.',\n",
       " \"But the onus isn't on physicians individually to self-care their way to a less stressful workday.\",\n",
       " 'In fact, that belief can further stress physicians, says Putnam.',\n",
