# Medical-News-of-2022-Topic-Modeling-Clustering-and-Classification

#### Summary
Worked in a team utilizing Jupyter Notebooks to web scrape 8,500 articles from Medscape, a medical news site for medical students, physicians, and other healthcare workers and indentified key topics and events from the period March 2022 - March 2023. Executed API requests and BeautifulSoup to collect article information (body of text, title, author, company) from each scraped HTML file. Manually classified sentence sentiment and applied several classification techniques to predict article sentiment. Finally, implimented LDA topic modeling and indentified 22 clearly defined topics of medical news, including COVID-19, mental health, abortion policies and access, healthcare costs and finances, monkeypox outbreak, and more. These topics were also supported in a k-means clustering analysis.
