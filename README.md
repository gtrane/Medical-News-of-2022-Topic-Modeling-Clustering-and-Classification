# News-in-Medicine-Topic-Clustering

Worked in a team utilizing Jupyter Notebooks to web scrape 8,500 articles from Medscape, a medical news site for medical students, physicians, and other healthcare workers. These articles were scraped from March 2022 - March 2023. 

Executed API requests and BeautifulSoup to collect article information (body text, titles, author, company) from each scraped HTML file. Classified sentence sentiment to then apply classification machine learning techniques. Finally, implimented LDA topic modeling and indentified 22 clearly defined topics of 2022 medical news, including COVID-19, mental health, abortion policies and access, healthcare costs and finances, monkeypox outbreak, and more. These topics were also supported in the k-means clustering analysis.
